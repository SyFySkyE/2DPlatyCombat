# 2DPlatyCombat
 
Dev log

3/3/20
At some point, I'll transfer this to a process journal.
But I get impatient when it comes to starting.
Anyway, I'm not sure what exactly I'm going for with this project.
I doubt it'll be the prototype for the 2D game of my dreams, but,
I really just wanna play around with Unity2D for once.
And I do know that I want to incorporate both speedy platforming /and/ combat.
Let's see if I can get something like that in here before the end of the night.
The code will probably be on the dirtier side. Probably won't be too many interfaces and subclasses.
That'll come if this develops into something. And if it does, the messier the code, the greater reason I have for remaking it.
Such as the words of Robert Nystrom.
Let's see what we can do.
I'll be using the Warped Citry Assets Pack by Ansimuz, like I did with the last 2D play around I did.
Might import some assets I made for that as well.
But let's not less focus juust yet.
Speedy platforming and combat.
